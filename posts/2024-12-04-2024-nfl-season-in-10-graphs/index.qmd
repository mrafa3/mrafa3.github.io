So what is clearly *not* working this year? Well, lots of things -- the Jets are a mess. But throughout Rodgers' career, two things stand out:

*  **Air EPA** was a strength of his game. He could push the ball down the field and add value to his team by completing passes that improve his team's expected points. Only in 2013 and 2017 -- both injury-shortened seasons -- did Rodgers post air EPA numbers below the league average. In 2024, his offense is more reliant on yards after the catch than in most of his career.
*  Rodgers has always posted above average EPA from **scrambles**, and this is the first season where that doesn't hold true. Whether it's the injury or just a reluctance to run, Rodgers is simply more stationary and less effective at scrambling at this stage in his career.


# "Passing is down league-wide..." 

...or is it?

Early in the season, there was a lot of discussion about how passing was down across the league. Defenses were deploying more cover 2 shell looks in an attempt to "keep a lid" on offenses.

::: column-margin
Like, do we think OCs just forgot how to attack 2-high coverages?
:::

What we're seeing is a "higher floor, lower cieling" league as far as passing goes. **Only two teams in 2024 average less than 200 yards passing, while no teams average above 300.**

Note: I would love to do some analysis on defensive looks and give a more critical evaluation of this theme, but coverages (and personnel groupings) don't seem to be available in public NFL sources.

Joe Burrow and the Bengals look like they're *cooking* on offense (in terms of passing) -- and they mostly have been. But they are averaging {r top_2024_passing_team}, which would rank in the {r top_2024_passing_team_percentile}th percentile in the last 25 years. They've been very good, but not great in the historical context.

::: column-margin
Only 2 offenses -- the Bengals and the Seahawks -- had a passing attack that would rank in the top quartile from the last 25 seasons.
