# Introduction

I wanted to experiment with the `mapboxgl::` package to see what kinds of interactive maps I could produce in R. I've seen lots of great posts from Kyle Walker on the functionality of this new package, and I wanted to give it a try.

## Setup

**Required packages**:

```{r libraries, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mapgl)
```
I followed Kyle's instructions on [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n71qnOQD-d4) (and plan to purchase his material for deeper learning).

## Mapping

Steps: 

1.  Create a Mapbox account.
2.  Generate an access key.
3.  Using the `usethis::edit_r_environ()` function, add the Mapbox access token.
4.  Render the map as shown in the demo.

```{r initial_map, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mapboxgl(
  style = mapbox_style('satellite-streets'),
  center = c(-114.26608, 32.7213),
  zoom = 14,
  pitch = 80,
  bearing = 41
) |>
  add_raster_dem_source(
    id = 'mapbox-dem',
    url = 'mapbox://mapbox.mapbox-terrain-dem-v1',
    tileSize = 512,
    maxzoom = 14
  ) |>
  set_terrain(
    source = 'mapbox-dem',
    exaggeration = 1.5
  )
  
```

There's also functionality to overlay data (such as Census data), which would be a neat continuation.
