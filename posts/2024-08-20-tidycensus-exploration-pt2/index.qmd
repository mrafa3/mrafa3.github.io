# Introduction

In [Part One](https://mrafa3.github.io/posts/2024-08-13-tidycensus-exploration/), I demonstrated how to fetch data and do some basic analysis of U.S. Census data. Each API call with the `tidycensus::` package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling.

In this post, I'll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I'll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.

## Setup

```{r libraries, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(scales) # <1>
library(gt) # <2>
library(glue) # <3>

# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE', install = TRUE) # <4>
```

1. Loading the `scales::` package to transform ggplot scales simply (some people choose to explicitly define `scales::` in their code rather than loading the library).
2. The `gt()::` library provides functionality for creating ggplot-esque tables.
3. The `glue::` package allows for simple addition of HTML to ggplot graphics.
4. The first time that you're working with the `tidycensus::` package, you need to request an API key at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. The `install=` argument will install your personal key to the .Renviron file, and you won't need to use the `census_api_key()` function again.  

```{r my.theme, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
my.theme <- theme(
  plot.title = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(face="bold", size=22),
  plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(color="#444444", size=14),
  plot.caption = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(color="#444444"),
  axis.title = element_text(color="black", face="bold", size=12), 
  axis.text = element_text(color="black", size=18), 
  axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'),
  panel.background = element_blank(),
  # panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = 'gray96'),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank(), 
  legend.title=element_blank(), 
  legend.text = element_text(color="black", size=12, hjust=0),
  legend.position = 'top',
  strip.text = element_text(color="black", size=14))
```

# Data

For this analysis, I'm interested in looking at the most recent
state-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and I want to construct a longitudinal sense of the change in child poverty. 

First, let's revisit the different American Community Survey products -- **ACS-1** and **ACS-5**.

*What's the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?*


| Feature                    | ACS 1-Year Estimates                                 | ACS 5-Year Estimates                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection Period      | 12 months                                           | 60 months                                         |
| Population Coverage         | Areas with 65,000 or more people                    | All geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people |
| Sample Size                 | Smallest                                            | Largest                                           |
| Reliability                 | Less reliable due to smaller sample size            | More reliable due to larger sample size            |
| Currency                    | Most current data                                   | Less current, includes older data                 |
| Release Frequency           | Annually                                            | Annually                                          |
| Best Used For               | Analyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision | Analyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency |
| Example Usage               | Examining recent economic changes                   | Examining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups |


In Part One, I wanted to fetch the most recent, reliable estimates for state-level and county-level poverty data, which led me to use the 5-year estimates. For this post, I am interested in constructing a longitudinal dataset of the most recent year-on-year estimates. If I again used the 5-year estimates, I would be comparing results across years that include much of the same sampling period (as shown in the graphic below).

![The ACS-5 product has a 60-month sampling period for each annual release, meaning that 48 months of sampling overlap with each annual ACS-5 release[^1]](acs_sample_explained.png)

[^1]: Screenshot taken from the ACS 2018 Handbook, found here: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018_ch03.pdf.

For this analysis, I'll use the **1-year estimates** from the American Community Survey, which will limit my ability to analyze changes in geographic units with populations greater than 65,000.

As I did in Part One, I'll use the following series from the American Community Survey:

-   *B01001_003*: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial
    groups)
-   *B01001_027*: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial
    groups)
-   *B17001_004*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below
    poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years
-   *B17001_018*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below
    poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years

## Fetching from the `tidycensus::` API

```{r year_acs, include=TRUE}
years <- seq(2005, 2022) %>% # <5>
  setdiff(2020) # <6>
```

5. Data for the ACS-1 product begins in 2005.
6. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau does not have standard ACS products available for 2020. The `setdiff()` function removes 2020 from the vector.

Next, I'll define a function to fetch the ACS data for each year in the vector.

```{r experimental1, include=FALSE}
# exploring whether this should be structured differently, perhaps with a table

# var_table <- load_variables(2022, dataset = "acs1") %>% 
#   filter(str_detect(name, "B01001*"))
# 
# var_table2 <- load_variables(2022, dataset = "acs1") %>% 
#   filter(str_detect(name, "B17001*"))
# 
# acs_df <- get_acs(
#   geography = "county",
#   state = "CO",
#   survey = "acs1",
#   table = "B17001",
#   # summary_var = "B01001",
#   year = 2022
# ) %>%
#   left_join(x=.,
#             y=var_table2,
#             by=c("variable" = "name"))
```

```{r fetch_poverty_data, include=TRUE}
fetch_acs_data <- function(year) {
  get_acs(geography = "county", 
          state = "Colorado",
          survey = 'acs1',
          variables = c(male_u5_pop = 'B01001_003', 
                        female_u5_pop = 'B01001_027', 
                        male_u5_poverty = 'B17001_004', 
                        female_u5_poverty = 'B17001_018'),
          year = year,
          output = 'wide') %>% 
    mutate(year = year)
}
```

Then, I'll use `purrr::map_df()` to apply each year to the `fetch_acs_data()` function that I created, which will result in a single dataframe of all years.

```{r combined_acs_data, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
combined_acs_data <- map_df(years, fetch_acs_data)
```

## Data wrangling

*  Creating some fields to combine gender-based poverty estimates and calculate a percent of the child population measure

```{r df_mutate, include=TRUE, results='hide'}
combined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% 
  mutate(total_u5_popE = male_u5_popE + female_u5_popE,
         total_u5_povertyE = male_u5_povertyE + female_u5_povertyE,
         perc_u5_poverty = total_u5_povertyE / total_u5_popE)
```

*  Creating a `county` field that cleans the `county_state` field to only include the county name

```{r mutate_county_name, include=TRUE}
combined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% 
  mutate(county = str_remove(NAME, " County.*")) %>% 
  select(county, everything())
```

*  Reading in a table that maps Colorado's counties to a region of the state

```{r read_colorado_regions, include=TRUE}
colorado_regions <- read_csv('.//data/colorado_regions.csv', show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(region = as.factor(region))
```

*  (Finally) creating the `combined_acs_data` dataframe for longitudinal analysis

```{r join_colorado_regions, include=TRUE}
combined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% 
  left_join(x=.,
            y=colorado_regions,
            by='county')
```

# Analysis 

Data from the American Community Survey represents results from a sample (in this case, a 1-year sample -- "acs1") that come with a margin of error. Said another way, each data value is considered an estimate with a corresponding margin of error, which the Census Bureau calculates.[^2] Point estimates should be used with caution, and the provided margins of error are key to understanding the uncertainty from the sample around that estimate.

[^2]: By default the `tidycensus::` API provides the margin of error at the 90% confidence interval, but you can change this with the `moe_level` argument within `get_acs()`.

```{r gender_colors, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
gender_cols <- c(
  "Female" = "#eb4729", 
  "Male" = "#1b909a"
)

county_cols <- c(
  'Jefferson' = "#984ea3",
  'Other' = "lightgray"
)
```

I'll illustrate this uncertainty in the 2022 ACS-1 poverty data, using the `geom_errorbar()` function from ggplot. 

```{r viz_text, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
title_text <- 'Child poverty estimates for Colorado counties in 2022'
subtitle_text <- glue("<span style='color:#eb4729'>**Female**</span> and <span style='color:#1b909a'>**Male**</span> poverty, point estimates and margins of error<br>Children defined as those 5 years old and younger")
caption_text <- glue('Source: American Community Survey 2022 1-year estimate<br>Margins of error represent the 90% Confidence Interval<br>ACS-1 estimates only available for counties with more than 65,000 people')

title_text2 <- 'Child poverty estimates (% of total) for Colorado counties'
subtitle_text2 <- glue("<span style='color:#984ea3'>**Jefferson County**</span> highlighted<br>Children defined as those 5 years old and younger")
caption_text2 <- glue('Source: American Community Survey 1-year estimate<br>ACS-1 estimates only available for counties with more than 65,000 people')
```

```{r plot_margin_error, include=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, fig.align='center'}
# note that this would be fewer steps if I did another 
# API call to build the dataframe in tidy format

combined_acs_data %>%
  select(county, year, 
         male_u5_povertyE, male_u5_povertyM, female_u5_povertyE, female_u5_povertyM) %>% 
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 3:6,
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "estimate"
  ) %>%
  mutate(gender = if_else(str_detect(variable, "female"), "Female", "Male"),
         variable_type = if_else(str_detect(variable, "E$"), "estimate", "moe")) %>%
  select(-variable) %>% 
  spread(variable_type, estimate) %>% 
  ggplot(.,
         aes(x=estimate, 
             y=reorder(county, estimate), 
             color=gender)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=if_else(estimate - moe < 0, estimate - estimate, estimate - moe), 
                     xmax=estimate + moe), 
                 height = 0.4,
                 position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +
  labs(y='',
       x='\nNumber of children below the poverty line\n',
       caption=caption_text) + 
  ggtitle(title_text,
          subtitle=subtitle_text) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = gender_cols) + 
  my.theme + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

And now I can visualize the child poverty estimates in my home county (Jefferson) over time, from 2005-2022.

```{r lineplot_co, include=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6.2, fig.align='center'}
combined_acs_data %>% 
  group_by(county, region) %>%
  ggplot(.,
         aes(x=year,
             y=perc_u5_poverty,
             group=county,
             color = if_else(county == 'Jefferson', 'Jefferson', 'Other'))) +
  geom_line(data= . %>% filter(county != 'Jefferson')) +
  geom_line(data= . %>% filter(county == 'Jefferson')) + # <7>
  ggtitle(title_text2,
          subtitle = subtitle_text2) + 
  labs(y='',
       x='',
       caption=caption_text2) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = county_cols) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + 
  my.theme + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

7. Calling these two `geom_line()` functions separately, so that Jefferson County is rendered on top of all other counties.


# Bonus: Using Observable Plot

I'll show how to use Observable Plot to build some interactive graphics (this can be done with R, but I want to experiment more with what Javascript can do).

To use Observable Plot in Quarto, you need to first have your data object defined in an Observable JS object, which can be achieved by:

*  Reading in the object directly as an Observable JS object (such as with the `FileAttachment()` function), or
*  Converting your R or Python object using the `ojs_define()` function in an R or Python code chunk

Note that, if you choose the latter (which I'll do here), this object only operates when your site or knitr document is rendered (meaning, it won't execute as a code chunk like you can with R, Python, or SQL in Quarto).

```{r ojs_define_chunk, include=TRUE}
ojs_define(ojsd = combined_acs_data)
```

Then, I'll create a line plot of child poverty by county over time, faceting by region.

```{ojs plot_ojs_line, include=TRUE}
Plot.plot({
  <!-- using options from here to learn: https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets -->
  title: "Child poverty (%) in Colorado by county",
  caption: "Source: American Community Survey",
  width: 1200,
  heigh: 600,
  x: {nice: true,
      label: "Year",
      ticks: 5,
      tickFormat: d => d.toString(),
      labelFontSize: 50,
      tickSize: 5,
      tickFontSize: 12
  },
  color: {type: "categorical"},
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "Child poverty rate (%)",
    domain: [0, 100]
    <!-- labelFontSize: 50, -->
    <!-- tickFontSize: 50 -->
  },
  fx: {
    label: "Region"
    <!-- these are not working -->
    <!-- tickFontSize: 32, -->
    <!-- labelFontSize: 32 -->
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([0]),
    Plot.lineY(transpose(ojsd), {
    x: "year", 
    fx: "region",
    y: d => d.perc_u5_poverty * 100, 
    z: "county", 
    stroke: "region",
    tip: true})
  ]
})
```

Some comments on the above:

*  There are discussions online that indicate that not all Javascript styling works in Quarto, and this supports that (some font size elements don't seem to work, faceting options, etc.). I'd like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I'll just note that this is not my *favorite* styling.
*  Aside from some counties in the Front Range, there's pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates from one year to the next. 

```{r combined_acs_data2, include=FALSE}
# I'll rebuild this chart, using a 3-year moving average with the `zoo::rollmean()` function.
# combined_acs_data2 <- combined_acs_data %>% 
  # group_by(county) %>%
  # mutate(u5_perc_poverty_3_yr_moving_avg = rollmean(perc_u5_poverty, k=3, fill=NA, align='right'))
```

```{r define_ojsd2, include=FALSE}
# ojs_define(ojsd2 = combined_acs_data2)
```

```{ojs plot_ojs_line2, include=FALSE}

<!--   ] -->
<!-- }) -->
```

# Conclusion

In this `tidycensus::` post, I demonstrated:

-   How to fetch data across multiple years from the U.S. Census Bureau and wrangle the data for longitudinal analysis
-   How to move between R or Python objects and Observable JS objects in Quarto 
-   How to make some simple interactive graphics with Observable Plot

More to come on poverty analysis in future posts!
