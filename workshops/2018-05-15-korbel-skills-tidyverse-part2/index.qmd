This is a continuation of the "Data Manipulation and Visualization Basics using R" workshop, which was originally delivered in 2018. This post assumes that you know the content from Part 1.

# Overview

This workshop session will help you familiarize with two of R's most widely used packages, `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. These packages are part of what is called the **tidyverse**, which is a collection of packages that are designed to work together in R to simplify and data manipulation, discovery, visualization, analysis, and more.[^1]

`dplyr` is designed to standardize the data management and manipulation process in R. `dplyr` has a small set of functions that help users navigate the most common challenges of data manipulation.[^2]  Generally speaking, these include restructuring, filtering, grouping, and summarizing your data, as well as creating new variables for your analysis.  

`ggplot2` is a package for visualizing data. In this lesson, we will learn the building blocks for creating beautiful visualizations. We will learn how to produce **histograms**, **scatter plots**, and **line plots**, and we will visualize ungrouped and grouped data.  

`dplyr` and `ggplot2` are packages that supply a **grammar** for data manipulation and data visualization, respectively. This workshop will only scratch the surface of what is possible, but learning the fundamentals of these packages can empower you to do a ton of exciting things in R.

# Part Two: Analysis of U.S. Supreme Court data

<center>

![The U.S. Supreme Court](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Oblique_facade_2%2C_US_Supreme_Court.jpg/1024px-Oblique_facade_2%2C_US_Supreme_Court.jpg)

</center>

1.  Install the tidyverse and gapminder packages (`install.packages()`)  

```{r install_tidyverse, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

2.  Load the tidyverse and gapminder packages (`library()` and `require()` effectively do the same thing, but `library()` provides more information that is occasionally useful)  

```{r read_libraries, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)      #for data management, manipulation, visualization, and exploratory data analysis

#for graphics styling
library(ggtext)         #for use of richtext in graphics
library(glue)           #to embed html in text
library(patchwork)      #for plot_annotation() function
```

3.  I am providing a dataset on all U.S. Supreme Court decisions since 1946, which are organized by case and justice vote. These data come from The Supreme Court Database at the Washington University in St. Louis Law School.[^10] I'd like for you to put together the skills that you've learned in this session to do some exploratory analysis of the data. 

[^10]: http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php

```{r read_sup_court, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court <- read.csv(url("https://github.com/mrafa3/korbel-skills-workshops/raw/master/supreme_court_1946_2018.csv"))
```

4.  Let's look at the data together. Use the `glimpse()` function to peek at the sup_court object.

```{r glimpse_sup_court, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
glimpse(sup_court)
```

Explore the dataset on your own, and see what you can find! Try to ask a question of the dataset and come up with an answer. In case you want some examples to guide you, you might ask (the "Code" box is there if you are stuck, but try your best to do this on your own.)...

*  Which Chief Justice has presided over the most cases since 1946? Which has heard the fewest?  

```{r sup_court_q1, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  group_by(chief) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_cases))
```

*  How many decisions has Justice Gorsuch made in his short tenure on the bench? How often has he cast a dissenting opinion? How often has he made decisions that would be considered conservative? What types of cases has he heard most often to this point? (hint: Gorsuch can be found using the justiceName variable with **NMGorsuch**.) 

```{r sup_court_q2_1, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(justiceName == 'NMGorsuch') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n())
```

```{r sup_court_q2_2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(justiceName == 'NMGorsuch') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, majorityName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n())
```

```{r sup_court_q2_3, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(justiceName == 'NMGorsuch') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, directionName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n())
```

```{r sup_court_q2_4, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(justiceName == 'NMGorsuch') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, issueAreaName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  mutate(perc_cases = round(count_cases / sum(count_cases) * 100, 1)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc_cases))
```

*  Justice Kennedy has a reputation as being the swing voter on the Supreme Court. How might you test this conventional wisdom with this dataset? (hint: you might consider using the **majVotes** and **minVotes** variables for this question) 

```{r sup_court_q3, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(majVotes == 5,
         minVotes == 4) %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, majorityName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  mutate(perc_cases = round(count_cases / sum(count_cases) * 100, 1)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc_cases))
```

*  Which justice has heard the most Supreme Court Cases since 1946? (hint: the justice is the primary unit of analysis) 

```{r sup_court_q4, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
sup_court %>% 
  group_by(justiceName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_cases))
```

*  What are the trends in the types of case heard by term? What is the trend in civil rights cases -- compared with other issue areas -- over time? (hint: **BY term and issue area**)

```{r sup_court_term_issue_df, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
(sup_court_term_issue <- sup_court %>% 
  group_by(term, issueAreaName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  arrange(term, desc(count_cases)))
```

```{r sup_court_issue_history_viz1, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6.2, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
sup_court_term_issue %>% 
  filter(!is.na(issueAreaName)) %>% 
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=term,
                y=count_cases,
                color=issueAreaName))
```

To create a graphic, I'll show how you can create a theme to add to your ggplot object.

```{r my.theme, include=TRUE}
my.theme <- theme(
  text = element_text(family = 'Arial'), 
  plot.title = element_textbox_simple(color="black", face="bold", size=18, hjust=0), 
  plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(color="black", size=12, hjust=0), 
  axis.text = element_text(size=15), 
  axis.ticks = element_line(color="gray90"),
  plot.caption = element_textbox_simple(color="black", size=12), 
  panel.background =  element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_line(color="gray90"),
  panel.border = element_blank(), 
  legend.position = 'none',
  strip.text = element_text(color="black", size=14, face='bold'),
  strip.background = element_blank())
```

And I'll create objects for the title, subtitle, and caption text.

```{r plot_text, include=TRUE}
title_text <- glue("Count of <span style='color:darkgreen;font-face:bold'>civil rights</span> cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court over time")
subtitle_text <- glue("<br>Count of cases")
caption_text <- glue("*The Supreme Court Database* at the Washington University in St. Louis Law School")
```

```{r sup_court_issue_history_viz2, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6.2, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
sup_court_term_issue %>% 
  filter(!is.na(issueAreaName)) %>% 
  mutate(CivilRights = ifelse(issueAreaName=='Civil Rights', 'Civil Rights', 'Other')) %>% 
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=term,
                y=count_cases,
                group=issueAreaName,
                color=CivilRights),
            linewidth=1.1) + 
  labs(x='',
       y='') + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('Civil Rights' = 'darkgreen',
                                'Other' = 'lightgray')) +
  my.theme + 
  plot_annotation(
    title = title_text,
    subtitle = subtitle_text,
    caption = caption_text, 
    theme = theme(text = element_text(family = 'Arial'),
                  plot.title = element_textbox_simple(color="black", 
                                                      face="bold", size=20, hjust=0),
                  plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(color="black", 
                                                      size=15, hjust=0),
                  plot.caption = element_textbox_simple(color="black")))
```

*  Does the Court seem to have strong tendencies for votes based on the issue area? (*Probably many ways that you could think about answering this one.*)

```{r baseline_vote, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7}
#Restricting to cases since 1980
(baseline_vote <- sup_court %>% 
  filter(term > 1980) %>% 
  mutate(liberal_vote = ifelse(directionName == 'liberal', 1,
                        ifelse(directionName == 'conservative', 0, NA))) %>% 
  group_by(issueAreaName) %>% 
  summarise(baseline_issue_vote = mean(liberal_vote, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(baseline_issue_vote)) %>% 
  arrange(-baseline_issue_vote) %>% 
  ungroup())
```

*  Justice Scalia was known as a staunch conservative presence on the bench. Were there some issues that he leaned more centrist? (hint: `group_by()` and `summarise()` would come in handy here, yet again)  

```{r sup_court_scalia_issues, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=10}
sup_court %>% 
  filter(justiceName == 'AScalia') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, issueAreaName, directionName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% 
  mutate(perc_cases = round(count_cases / sum(count_cases) *100, 1)) %>% 
  filter(directionName == 'liberal') %>% 
  arrange(-perc_cases)
```

* To truly answer a question like the previous one, you would want to take into account the directionality of 
all voting justices by issue area. For instance, if you explored the previous question, you found that Scalia voted "liberal" on almost 70% of Federal Taxation cases. However, if the Court has a tendency to vote liberal on this issue, then Scalia might not be as "liberal" on this issue as it might seem. This question is a bit more complicated, but does Scalia *lean liberal* based on the Court's tendencies in Federal Taxation Cases? (*This question still uses `dplyr` -- and if you'd like, `ggplot2` -- but with a few bells and whistles.*)

```{r baseline_vote_fedtax, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
(sup_court_fedtax <- sup_court %>% 
  filter(term > 1980, issueAreaName == 'Federal Taxation') %>% 
  group_by(justiceName, issueAreaName, directionName) %>% 
  summarise(count_cases = n(), .groups = "drop_last") %>% 
  mutate(perc_cases = count_cases / sum(count_cases)) %>% 
  filter(directionName == 'liberal') %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(x=.,
            y=baseline_vote,
            by='issueAreaName'))
```

```{r library_scales, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(scales)                 #for changing axis label to include '%'
```

```{r plot_fedtax, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6.2, fig.width=10, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
sup_court_fedtax %>% 
  filter(count_cases >=10) %>% 
  mutate(fedtax_lean = ifelse(perc_cases > baseline_issue_vote, 'Liberal', 'Conservative')) %>% 
  ggplot(.) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=perc_cases,
                 y=reorder(justiceName, perc_cases),
                 color=fedtax_lean), size=5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = sup_court_fedtax$baseline_issue_vote) + 
  annotate(geom='text', x=.48, y='JGRoberts', 
           label=paste('Baseline vote for Federal Taxation cases is ', 
                       round(sup_court_fedtax$baseline_issue_vote[1] * 100), '%', sep = ''),
           size=5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent,
                     limits = c(0, 1)) + 
  ggtitle('The Court leans liberal on Federal Taxation cases',
          subtitle = 'Percent of Federal Taxation cases with liberal decision by Justice since 1980') + 
  labs(x='Percent of cases coded as a liberal decision\n',
       y='',
       color='',
       caption='Source: Washington University of St. Louis\nThe Supreme Court Database\nExcluded Justices with less than 10 Federal Taxation cases') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('Liberal' = 'blue',
                                'Conservative' = 'red')) + 
theme(legend.position = 'top',
        text = element_text(size=15),
        plot.title = element_text(size=18, face='bold'),

        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=16),
        strip.text = element_text(size=15, face='bold'))
```
