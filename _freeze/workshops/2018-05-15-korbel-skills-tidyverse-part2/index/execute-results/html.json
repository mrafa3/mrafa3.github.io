This post assumes that you know the content from Part 1.\n\n# Overview\n\nThis workshop session will help you familiarize with two of R's most widely used packages, `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. These packages are part of what is called the **tidyverse**, which is a collection of packages that are designed to work together in R to simplify and data manipulation, discovery, visualization, analysis, and more.[^1]\n\n<center>\n\n![Each tile is a package that makes up the \"tidyverse\"](tidyverse.png)\n\n</center>\n\n`dplyr` is designed to standardize the data management and manipulation process in R. `dplyr` has a small set of functions that help users navigate the most common challenges of data manipulation.[^2]  Generally speaking, these include restructuring, filtering, grouping, and summarizing your data, as well as creating new variables for your analysis.  \n\n`ggplot2` is a package for visualizing data. In this lesson, we will learn the building blocks for creating beautiful visualizations. We will learn how to produce **histograms**, **scatter plots**, and **line plots**, and we will visualize ungrouped and grouped data.  \n\n`dplyr` and `ggplot2` are packages that supply a **grammar** for data manipulation and data visualization, respectively. This workshop will only scratch the surface of what is possible, but learning the fundamentals of these packages can empower you to do a ton of exciting things in R.  \n\n[^1]: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/\n[^2]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html\n\n# Part Two: Analysis of U.S. Supreme Court data\n\n<center>\n\n![The U.S. Supreme Court](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Oblique_facade_2%2C_US_Supreme_Court.jpg/1024px-Oblique_facade_2%2C_US_Supreme_Court.jpg)\n\n</center>\n\n1.  Install the tidyverse and gapminder packages (`install.packages()`)  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Load the tidyverse and gapminder packages (`library()` and `require()` effectively do the same thing, but `library()` provides more information that is occasionally useful)  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)      #for data management, manipulation, visualization, and exploratory data analysis\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#for graphics styling\nlibrary(ggtext)         #for use of richtext in graphics\nlibrary(glue)           #to embed html in text\nlibrary(patchwork)      #for plot_annotation() function\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  I am providing a dataset on all U.S. Supreme Court decisions since 1946, which are organized by case and justice vote. These data come from The Supreme Court Database at the Washington University in St. Louis Law School.[^10] I'd like for you to put together the skills that you've learned in this session to do some exploratory analysis of the data. \n\n[^10]: http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsup_court <- read.csv(url(\"https://github.com/mrafa3/korbel-skills-workshops/raw/master/supreme_court_1946_2018.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.

(*Probably many ways that you could think about answering this one.*)\n\n\n\n\n\n*  Justice Scalia was known as a staunch conservative presence on the bench. Were there some issues that he leaned more centrist? (hint: `group_by()` and `summarise()` would come in handy here, yet again)  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsup_court %>% \n  filter(justiceName == 'AScalia') %>% \n  group_by(justiceName, issueAreaName, directionName) %>% \n  summarise(count_cases = n()) %>% \n  mutate(perc_cases = round(count_cases / sum(count_cases) *100, 1)) %>% \n  filter(directionName == 'liberal') %>% \n  arrange(-perc_cases)\n```\n:::\n\n\n* To truly answer a question like the previous one, you would want to take into account the directionality of \nall voting justices by issue area. For instance, if you explored the previous question, you found that Scalia voted \"liberal\" on almost 70% of Federal Taxation cases. However, if the Court has a tendency to vote liberal on this issue, then Scalia might not be as \"liberal\" on this issue as it might seem. This question is a bit more complicated, but does Scalia *lean liberal* based on the Court's tendencies in Federal Taxation Cases? (*This question still uses `dplyr` -- and if you'd like, `ggplot2` -- but with a few bells and whistles.*)\n\n**Temporarily commenting out this code**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#(sup_court_fedtax <- sup_court %>% \n # filter(term > 1980, issueAreaName == 'Federal Taxation') %>% \n  #group_by(justiceName, issueAreaName, directionName) %>% \n  #summarise(count_cases = n(), .groups = \"drop_last\") %>% \n  #mutate(perc_cases = count_cases / sum(count_cases)) %>% \n  #filter(directionName == 'liberal') %>% \n  #ungroup() %>% \n  #left_join(x=.,\n   #         y=baseline_vote,\n    #        by='issueAreaName'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#library(scales)                 #for changing axis label to include '%'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#sup_court_fedtax %>% \n # filter(count_cases >=10) %>% \n  #mutate(fedtax_lean = ifelse(perc_cases > baseline_issue_vote, 'Liberal', 'Conservative')) %>% \n  #ggplot(.) + \n  #geom_point(aes(x=perc_cases,\n   #              y=reorder(justiceName, perc_cases),\n    #             color=fedtax_lean), size=5) + \n  #geom_vline(xintercept = sup_court_fedtax$baseline_issue_vote) + \n  #annotate(geom='text', x=.48, y='JGRoberts', \n   #        label=paste('Baseline vote for Federal Taxation cases is ', \n    #                   round(sup_court_fedtax$baseline_issue_vote[1] * 100), '%', sep = ''),\n     #      size=5) + \n  #scale_x_continuous(labels = percent,\n   #                  limits = c(0, 1)) + \n  #ggtitle('The Court leans liberal on Federal Taxation cases',\n   #       subtitle = 'Percent of Federal Taxation cases with liberal decision by Justice since 1980') + \n  #labs(x='Percent of cases coded as a liberal decision\\n',\n   #    y='',\n    #   color='',\n     #  caption='Source: Washington University of St. Louis\\nThe Supreme Court Database\\nExcluded Justices with less than 10 Federal Taxation cases') + \n  #theme_minimal() + \n  #scale_color_manual(values = c('Liberal' = 'blue',\n   #                             'Conservative' = 'red')) + \n  \n#theme(legend.position = 'top',\n #       text = element_text(size=15),\n  #      plot.title = element_text(size=18, face='bold'),\n#\n #       plot.subtitle = element_text(size=16),\n  #      strip.text = element_text(size=15, face='bold'))\n```\n:::\n",
