I've seen lots of great posts from Kyle Walker on the functionality of this new package, and I wanted to give it a try.\n\n## Setup\n\n**Required packages**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mapgl)\n```\n:::\n\nI followed Kyle's instructions on [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n71qnOQD-d4) (and plan to purchase his material for deeper learning).\n\n## Mapping\n\nSteps: \n\n1.  Create a Mapbox account.\n2.  Generate an access key.\n3.  Using the `usethis::edit_r_environ()` function, add the Mapbox access token.\n4.  Render the map as shown in the demo.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# commenting out code as it doesn't render on Github pages, but it works in Quarto\n# mapboxgl(\n#   style = mapbox_style('satellite-streets'),\n#   center = c(-114.26608, 32.7213),\n#   zoom = 14,\n#   pitch = 80,\n#   bearing = 41\n# ) |>\n#   add_raster_dem_source(\n#     id = 'mapbox-dem',\n#     url = 'mapbox://mapbox.mapbox-terrain-dem-v1',\n#     tileSize = 512,\n#     maxzoom = 14\n#   ) |>\n#   set_terrain(\n#     source = 'mapbox-dem',\n#     exaggeration = 1.5\n#   )\n```\n:::\n\n\nSome further pieces still to figure out:\n\n1.  It looks like I'm unable to render the interactive map on my Github pages site (I receive an error that it's not an in-memory calc).\n2.  There's also functionality to overlay data (such as Census data), which would be a neat continuation to explore. \n3.  Soon, I'd like to use this to map Mount Blue Sky -- our most recent 14er hike in Colorado!\n",
