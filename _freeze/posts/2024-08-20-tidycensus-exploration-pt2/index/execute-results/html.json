Each API call with the `tidycensus::` package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling. In this post, I'll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I'll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\n# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nFor this demo, I'll use the following series from the American Community Survey (ACS):\n\n-   *B01001_003*: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B01001_027*: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B17001_004*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years\n-   *B17001_018*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years\n\nWith the `tidycensus::` package, I can gather 5-year ACS data for these series from 2009 to 2022.[^1]\n\n[^1]: According to the `tidycensus::` documentation, 5-year ACS data is available from 2009 through 2022, with the exception of 2020.\n\n## Fetching from the `tidycensus::` API\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyears <- seq(2009, 2022) %>% \n  # no 2020 data from the ACS\n  setdiff(2020)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, I'll define a function to fetch the ACS data for each year in the vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define a function to fetch ACS data for a given year\nfetch_acs_data <- function(year) {\n  get_acs(geography = \"county\", \n          state = \"Colorado\",\n          variables = c('B01001_003', 'B01001_027', 'B17001_004', 'B17001_018'),\n          year = year,\n          output = 'wide')\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, I'll map the years vector to the `fetch_acs_data()` function that I created.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use map() to apply fetch_acs_data to each year\nacs_data_list <- map(years, fetch_acs_data)\n```\n\n:::

'u5_female_estimate', 'u5_female_moe',\n               'u5_male_pov_estimate', 'u5_male_pov_moe',\n               'u5_female_pov_estimate', 'u5_female_pov_moe',\n

  u5_perc_in_poverty = u5_pov_total / u5_pop_total)\n```\n:::\n\n\n*  Creating a `county` field that cleans the `county_state` field to only include the county name\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

as.factor(region))\n```\n:::\n\n*  (Finally) creating the `combined_acs_data` dataframe for longitudinal analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  left_join(x=.,\n            y=colorado_regions,\n            by='county')\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Analysis \n\n\n\n\n\nFor the graphics, I'll use Observable Plot to build some interactive graphics (this can be done with R, but I want to experiment more with what Javascript can do).\n\nTo use Observable Plot in Quarto, you need to first have your data object defined in an Observable JS object, which can be achieved by:\n\n*  Reading in the object directly as an Observable JS object (such as with the `FileAttachment()` function), or\n*  Converting your R or Python object using the `ojs_define()` function in an R or Python code chunk\n\nNote that, if you choose the latter (which I'll do here), this object only operates when your site or knitr document is rendered (meaning, it won't execute as a code chunk like you can with R, Python, or SQL in Quarto).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nojs_define(ojsd = combined_acs_data)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, I'll create a line plot of child poverty by county over time, faceting by region.\n\n\n```{ojs}\nPlot.plot({\n  <!-- using options from here to learn: https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets -->\n  title: \"Child poverty (%) in Colorado by county\",\n  caption: \"Source: American Community Survey\",\n  width: 1200,\n  heigh: 600,\n  x: {nice: true,\n      label: \"Year\",\n      ticks: 5,\n      tickFormat: d => d.toString(),\n      labelFontSize: 50,\n      tickSize: 5,\n      tickFontSize: 12\n  },\n  color: {type: \"categorical\"},\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Child poverty rate (%)\",\n    domain: [0, 100]\n    <!-- labelFontSize: 50, -->\n    <!-- tickFontSize: 50 -->\n  },\n  fx: {\n    label: \"Region\"\n    <!-- these are not working -->\n    <!-- tickFontSize: 32, -->\n    <!-- labelFontSize: 32 -->\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.ruleY([0]),\n    Plot.lineY(transpose(ojsd), {\n    x: \"year\", \n    fx: \"region\",\n    y: d => d.u5_perc_in_poverty * 100, \n    z: \"county\", \n    stroke: \"region\",\n    tip: true})\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n\nSome comments on the above:\n\n*  There are discussions online that indicate that not all Javascript styling works in Quarto, and this supports that (some font size elements don't seem to work, faceting options, etc.). I'd like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I'll just note that this is not my *favorite* styling.\n*  Aside from the Front Range, which is showing some smooth patterns, there's pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates. I'll rebuild this chart, using a 3-year moving average with the `zoo::rollmean()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data2 <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  group_by(county) %>%\n  mutate(u5_perc_poverty_3_yr_moving_avg = rollmean(u5_perc_in_poverty, k=3, fill=NA, align='right'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n```{ojs}\nPlot.plot({\n  <!-- using options from here to learn: https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets -->\n  title: \"Child poverty (%) in Colorado by county\",\n  caption: \"Source: American Community Survey. Generated 3-year moving average to smooth results.\",\n  width: 1200,\n  x: {nice: true,\n      tickFormat: d => d.toString()\n      },\n  <!-- y: {inset: 5}, -->\n  color: {type: \"categorical\"},\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Child poverty rate (%)\",\n    domain: [0, 100]\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.ruleY([0]),\n    Plot.lineY(transpose(ojsd2), {\n    x: \"year\", \n    fx: \"region\",\n    y: d => d.u5_perc_poverty_3_yr_moving_avg * 100, \n    z: \"county\", \n    stroke: \"region\",\n    tip: true})\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this `tidycensus::` post, I demonstrated:\n\n-   How to fetch data across multiple years from the U.S. Census Bureau and wrangle the data for longitudinal analysis\n-   How to move between R or Python objects and Observable JS objects in Quarto \n-   How to make some simple interactive graphics with Observable Plot\n\nMore to come on poverty analysis in future posts!",
