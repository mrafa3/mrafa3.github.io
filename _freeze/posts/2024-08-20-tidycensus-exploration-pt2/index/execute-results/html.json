Each API call with the `tidycensus::` package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling.\n\nIn this post, I'll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I'll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nFor this analysis, I'm interested in looking at the most recent\nstate-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and I want to construct a longitudinal sense of the change in child poverty. \n\nFirst, let's revisit the different American Community Survey products -- **ACS-1** and **ACS-5**.\n\n*What's the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?*\n\n\n| Feature                    | ACS 1-Year Estimates                                 | ACS 5-Year Estimates                               |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Collection Period      | 12 months                                           | 60 months                                         |\n| Population Coverage         | Areas with 65,000 or more people                    | All geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people |\n| Sample Size                 | Smallest                                            | Largest                                           |\n| Reliability                 | Less reliable due to smaller sample size            | More reliable due to larger sample size            |\n| Currency                    | Most current data                                   | Less current, includes older data                 |\n| Release Frequency           | Annually                                            | Annually                                          |\n| Best Used For               | Analyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision | Analyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency |\n| Example Usage               | Examining recent economic changes                   | Examining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups |\n\n\nIn Part One, I wanted to fetch the most recent, reliable estimates for state-level and county-level poverty data, which led me to use the 5-year estimates. For this post, I am interested in constructing a longitudinal dataset of the most recent year-on-year estimates. If I again used the 5-year estimates, I would be comparing results across years that include much of the same sampling period (as shown in the graphic below).\n\n![The ACS-5 product has a 60-month sampling period for each annual release, meaning that 48 months of sampling overlap with each annual ACS-5 release[^1]](acs_sample_explained.png)\n\n[^1]: Screenshot taken from the ACS 2018 Handbook, found here: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018_ch03.pdf.\n\nFor this analysis, I'll use the **1-year estimates** from the American Community Survey, which will limit my ability to analyze changes in geographic units with populations greater than 65,000.\n\nAs I did in Part One, I'll use the following series from the American Community Survey:\n\n-   *B01001_003*: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B01001_027*: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B17001_004*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years\n-   *B17001_018*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years\n\n## Fetching from the `tidycensus::` API\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# data for ACS-1 begins in 2005, but will start in 2015\nyears <- seq(2015, 2022) %>% \n  #

I'd like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I'll just note that this is not my *favorite* styling.\n*  Aside from the Front Range, which is showing some smooth patterns, there's pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates. I'll rebuild this chart, using a 3-year moving average with the `zoo::rollmean()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
