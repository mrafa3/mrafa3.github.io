Each API call with the `tidycensus::` package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling.\n\nIn this post, I'll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I'll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(scales) # <1>\nlibrary(gt) # <2>\nlibrary(glue) # <3>\n\n# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE', install = TRUE) # <4>\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. Loading the `scales::` package to transform ggplot scales simply (some people choose to explicitly define `scales::` in their code rather than loading the library).\n2. The `gt::` library provides functionality for creating ggplot-esque tables.\n3. The `glue::` package allows for simple addition of HTML to ggplot graphics.\n4. The first time that you're working with the `tidycensus::` package, you need to request an API key at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. The `install=` argument will install your personal key to the .Renviron file, and you won't need to use the `census_api_key()` function again.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nFor this analysis, I'm interested in looking at the most recent\nstate-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and I want to construct a longitudinal sense of the change in child poverty. \n\nFirst, let's revisit the different American Community Survey products -- **ACS-1** and **ACS-5**.\n\n*What's the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?*\n\n\n| Feature                    | ACS 1-Year Estimates                                 | ACS 5-Year Estimates                               |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Collection Period      | 12 months                                           | 60 months                                         |\n| Population Coverage         | Areas with 65,000 or more people                    | All geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people |\n| Sample Size                 | Smallest                                            | Largest                                           |\n| Reliability                 | Less reliable due to smaller sample size            | More reliable due to larger sample size            |\n| Currency                    | Most current data                                   | Less current, includes older data                 |\n| Release Frequency           | Annually                                            | Annually                                          |\n| Best Used For               | Analyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision | Analyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency |\n| Example Usage               | Examining recent economic changes                   | Examining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups |\n\n\nIn Part One, I wanted to fetch the most recent, reliable estimates for state-level and county-level poverty data, which led me to use the 5-year estimates. For this post, I am interested in constructing a longitudinal dataset of the most recent year-on-year estimates. If I again used the 5-year estimates, I would be comparing results across years that include much of the same sampling period (as shown in the graphic below).\n\n![The ACS-5 product has a 60-month sampling period for each annual release, meaning that 48 months of sampling overlap with each annual ACS-5 release[^1]](acs_sample_explained.png)\n\n[^1]: Screenshot taken from the ACS 2018 Handbook, found here: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018_ch03.pdf.\n\nFor this analysis, I'll use the **1-year estimates** from the American Community Survey, which will limit my ability to analyze changes in geographic units with populations greater than 65,000.\n\nAs I did in Part One, I'll use the following series from the American Community Survey:\n\n-   *B01001_003*: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B01001_027*: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B17001_004*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years\n-   *B17001_018*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years\n\n## Fetching from the `tidycensus::` API\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyears <- seq(2005, 2022) %>% # <5>\n  setdiff(2020) # <6>\n```\n:::\n\n\n5. Data for the ACS-1 product begins in 2005.\n6. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau does not have standard ACS products available for 2020. The `setdiff()` function removes 2020 from the vector.\n\nNext, I'll define a function to fetch the ACS data for each year in the vector.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfetch_acs_data <- function(year) {\n  get_acs(geography = \"county\", \n          state = \"Colorado\",\n          survey = 'acs1',\n          variables = c(male_u5_pop = 'B01001_003', \n                        female_u5_pop = 'B01001_027', \n                        male_u5_poverty = 'B17001_004', \n                        female_u5_poverty = 'B17001_018'),\n          year = year,\n          output = 'wide') %>% \n    mutate(year = year)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, I'll use `purrr::map_df()` to apply each year to the `fetch_acs_data()` function that I created, which will result in a single dataframe of all years.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data <- map_df(years, fetch_acs_data)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data wrangling\n\n*  Creating some fields to combine gender-based poverty estimates and calculate a percent of the child population measure\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  mutate(total_u5_popE = male_u5_popE + female_u5_popE,\n         total_u5_povertyE = male_u5_povertyE + female_u5_povertyE,\n         perc_u5_poverty = total_u5_povertyE / total_u5_popE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n*  Creating a `county` field that cleans the `county_state` field to only include the county name\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  mutate(county = str_remove(NAME, \" County.*\")) %>% \n  select(county, everything())\n```\n:::\n\n\n*  Reading in a table that maps Colorado's counties to a region of the state\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolorado_regions <- read_csv('.//data/colorado_regions.csv', show_col_types = FALSE) %>%\n  mutate(region = as.factor(region))\n```\n:::\n\n\n*  (Finally) creating the `combined_acs_data` dataframe for longitudinal analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  left_join(x=.,\n            y=colorado_regions,\n            by='county')\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Analysis \n\nData from the American Community Survey represents results from a sample (in this case, a 1-year sample -- \"acs1\") that come with a margin of error. Said another way, each data value is considered an estimate with a corresponding margin of error, which the Census Bureau calculates.[^2] Point estimates should be used with caution, and the provided margins of error are key to understanding the uncertainty from the sample around that estimate.\n\n[^2]: By default the `tidycensus::` API provides the margin of error at the 90% confidence interval, but you can change this with the `moe_level` argument within `get_acs()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI'll illustrate this uncertainty in the 2022 ACS-1 poverty data, using the `geom_errorbar()` function from ggplot. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# note that this would be fewer steps if I did another \n# API call to build the dataframe in tidy format\n\ncombined_acs_data %>%\n  select(county, year, \n         male_u5_povertyE, male_u5_povertyM, female_u5_povertyE, female_u5_povertyM) %>% \n  filter(year == 2022) %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = 3:6,\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"estimate\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(gender = if_else(str_detect(variable, \"female\"), \"Female\", \"Male\"),\n         variable_type = if_else(str_detect(variable, \"E$\"), \"estimate\", \"moe\")) %>%\n  select(-variable) %>% \n  spread(variable_type, estimate) %>% \n  ggplot(.,\n         aes(x=estimate, \n             y=reorder(county, estimate), \n             color=gender)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=if_else(estimate - moe < 0, estimate - estimate, estimate - moe), \n                     xmax=estimate + moe), \n                 height = 0.4,\n                 position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +\n  labs(y='',\n       x='\\nNumber of children below the poverty line\\n',\n       caption=caption_text) + \n  ggtitle(title_text,\n          subtitle=subtitle_text) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = gender_cols) + \n  my.theme + \n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_margin_error-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd now I can visualize the child poverty estimates in my home county (Jefferson) over time, from 2005-2022.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data %>% \n  group_by(county, region) %>%\n  ggplot(.,\n         aes(x=year,\n             y=perc_u5_poverty,\n             group=county,\n             color = if_else(county == 'Jefferson', 'Jefferson', 'Other'))) +\n  geom_line(data= . %>% filter(county != 'Jefferson')) +\n  geom_line(data= . %>% filter(county == 'Jefferson')) + # <7>\n  ggtitle(title_text2,\n          subtitle = subtitle_text2) + \n  labs(y='',\n       x='',\n       caption=caption_text2) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = county_cols) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + \n  my.theme + \n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/lineplot_co-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n7.

I'd like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I'll just note that this is not my *favorite* styling.\n*  Aside from some counties in the Front Range, there's pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates from one year to the next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this `tidycensus::` post, I demonstrated:\n\n-   How to fetch data across multiple years from the U.S. Census Bureau and wrangle the data for longitudinal analysis\n-   How to move between R or Python objects and Observable JS objects in Quarto \n-   How to make some simple interactive graphics with Observable Plot\n\nMore to come on poverty analysis in future posts!\n",
