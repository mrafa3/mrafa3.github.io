Each API call with the `tidycensus::` package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling. In this post, I'll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I'll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\n# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nFor this analysis, I'm interested in looking at the most recent\nstate-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and I want to construct a longitudinal sense of the change in child poverty. \n\nFirst, let's revisit the different American Community Survey products -- **ACS-1** and **ACS-5**.\n\n*What's the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?*[^1]\n\n\n| Feature                    | ACS 1-Year Estimates                                 | ACS 5-Year Estimates                               |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Collection Period      | 12 months                                           | 60 months                                         |\n| Population Coverage         | Areas with 65,000 or more people                    | All geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people |\n| Sample Size                 | Smallest                                            | Largest                                           |\n| Reliability                 | Less reliable due to smaller sample size            | More reliable due to larger sample size            |\n| Currency                    | Most current data                                   | Less current, includes older data                 |\n| Release Frequency           | Annually                                            | Annually                                          |\n| Best Used For               | Analyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision | Analyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency |\n| Example Usage               | Examining recent economic changes                   | Examining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups |\n\n\nIn Part One, I wanted to fetch the most recent, reliable estimates for state-level and county-level poverty data, which led me to use the 5-year estimates. For this post, I am interested in constructing a longitudinal dataset of the most recent year-on-year estimates. If I again used the 5-year estimates, I would be comparing results across years that include much of the same sampling period (as shown in the graphic below).\n\n![The ACS-5 product has a 60-month sampling period for each annual release, meaning that 48 months of sampling overlap with each annual ACS-5 release[^1]](acs_sample_explained.png)\n\n[^1]: Screenshot taken from the ACS 2018 Handbook, found here: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018_ch03.pdf.\n\nFor this analysis, I'll use the 1-year estimates from the American Community Survey, which will limit my ability to analyze changes in geographic units with populations greater than 65,000.\n\nAs I did in Part One, I'll use the following series from the American Community Survey:\n\n-   *B01001_003*: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B01001_027*: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial\n    groups)\n-   *B17001_004*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years\n-   *B17001_018*: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below\n    poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years\n\n## Fetching from the `tidycensus::` API\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyears <- seq(2009, 2022) %>% \n  # no 2020 data from the ACS\n

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the graphics, I'll use Observable Plot to build some interactive graphics (this can be done with R, but I want to experiment more with what Javascript can do).\n\nTo use Observable Plot in Quarto, you need to first have your data object defined in an Observable JS object, which can be achieved by:\n\n*  Reading in the object directly as an Observable JS object (such as with the `FileAttachment()` function), or\n*  Converting your R or Python object using the `ojs_define()` function in an R or Python code chunk\n\nNote that, if you choose the latter (which I'll do here), this object only operates when your site or knitr document is rendered (meaning, it won't execute as a code chunk like you can with R, Python, or SQL in Quarto).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nojs_define(ojsd = combined_acs_data)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, I'll create a line plot of child poverty by county over time, faceting by region.\n\n\n```{ojs}\nPlot.plot({\n  <!-- using options from here to learn: https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets -->\n  title: \"Child poverty (%) in Colorado by county\",\n  caption: \"Source: American Community Survey\",\n  width:

are discussions online that indicate that not all Javascript styling works in Quarto, and this supports that (some font size elements don't seem to work, faceting options, etc.). I'd like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I'll just note that this is not my *favorite* styling.\n*  Aside from the Front Range, which is showing some smooth patterns, there's pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates. I'll rebuild this chart, using a 3-year moving average with the `zoo::rollmean()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_acs_data2 <- combined_acs_data %>% \n  group_by(county) %>%\n  mutate(u5_perc_poverty_3_yr_moving_avg = rollmean(u5_perc_in_poverty, k=3, fill=NA, align='right'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n```{ojs}\nPlot.plot({\n  <!-- using options from here to learn: https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets -->\n  title: \"Child poverty (%) in Colorado by county\",\n  caption: \"Source: American Community Survey.
