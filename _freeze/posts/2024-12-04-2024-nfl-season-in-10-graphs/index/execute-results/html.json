Four of those QBs saw significant snaps during the season: Caleb Williams (Chicago, Pick #1), Jayden Daniels (Washington, Pick #2), Drake Maye (New England, Pick #3), and Bo Nix (Denver, Pick #12).\n\n:::  column-margin\nSix QBs selected in the first round ties the record set in the 1983 draft -- the draft that included John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Dan Marino.\n:::\n\nJayden Daniels' had the best campaign of this rookie class and among the best seasons among all passers. Daniels finished fourth in total quarterback rating (QBR) and in total expected points added (EPA), the two primary composite metrics used to evaluate quarterback play. And not only that, Daniels led the Commanders to a surprising NFC title birth in his rookie season.\n\nWhile this story could have centered on Jayden Daniels' successful year, or the volume of snaps played by this rookie class, the *inconsistency* of play stands out. Aside from Daniels' remarkable season, the other rookie first round QBs turned in a combined record of 19-30 in games that they started in. The below graphic shows the weekly EPA per dropback of the four first rounders with significant playing time, highlighting the performance of Daniels and Bo Nix, who each led their teams to the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlast_week_rookie_qb <- rookie_qb_epa_weekly_2024 %>%\n  group_by(passer) %>%\n  slice_max(week, n = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrookie_qb_epa_weekly_2024 %>% \n  ggplot(.,\n         aes(x=week,\n             y=mean_qb_epa,\n             color=posteam,\n             alpha=if_else(passer %in% c('C.Williams','D.Maye'), 'Not playoffs', 'Playoffs'))) + \n  geom_line(linewidth=1.2) + \n  geom_point(data=last_week_rookie_qb,\n             size=3) + \n  geom_text(data=last_week_rookie_qb,\n            aes(x=week + 1,\n                label=passer),\n            family='Lexend') + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color='black', linetype='dashed') + \n  labs(title='EPA per dropback of 1st round rookies in 2024',\n       # subtitle = glue('Through Week {max_week_param}'),\n       caption = 'Source: {nflverse} package<br>Minimum 10 attempts to qualify as a full game',\n       x='Week',\n       y='EPA/dropback') + \n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c('Not playoffs' = .3,\n                                'Playoffs' = 1)) + \n  theme_nfl_analytics() +\n  scale_color_nfl(type='secondary') + \n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_rookie_qb_epa-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  # theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle=0))\n```\n:::\n",
