    "text": "I’ve used data from the U.S. Census Bureau several times, and for this project, I wanted to reacquaint myself with the tidycensus:: package to gather and wrangle data. I also wanted to use the usmap:: package to generate a simple U.S. map, and the gt:: package to display the data in a nice table format.\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n1library(scales)\n2library(janitor)\n3library(glue)\n4library(gt)\nlibrary(usmap)\n\n5# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE', install = TRUE)\n\n\n1\n\nLoading the scales:: package to transform ggplot scales simply (some people choose to explicitly define scales:: in their code rather than loading the library).\n\n2\n\nThe janitor::clean_names() function tidies the column names of your dataset to use the snake case convention.

The install= argument will install your personal key to the .Renviron file, and you won’t need to use the census_api_key() function again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this analysis, I’m interested in looking at the most recent state-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The tidycensus:: package allows API access to the decennial Census, as well as the more frequent American Community Survey (ACS), which I’ll use in this project.\nIf you’ve worked with ACS data before, you may know that there are a few survey products offered in the ACS suite. Most commonly, the choice of data is between the 1-year estimates and the 5-year estimates.\nWhat’s the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nACS 1-Year Estimates\nACS 5-Year Estimates\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Period\n12 months\n60 months\n\n\nPopulation Coverage\nAreas with 65,000 or more people\nAll geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people\n\n\nSample Size\nSmallest\nLargest\n\n\nReliability\nLess reliable due to smaller sample size\nMore reliable due to larger sample size\n\n\nCurrency\nMost current data\nLess current, includes older data\n\n\nRelease Frequency\nAnnually\nAnnually\n\n\nBest Used For\nAnalyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision\nAnalyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency\n\n\nExample Usage\nExamining recent economic changes\nExamining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups\n\n\n\n\nTo start, I am interested in reviewing the most stable, geographically-available data on child poverty. Given that I’m less concerned with recency and more interested in broad availability, the ACS 5-year estimates are what I’ll use here.\n\n\n\nThe tidycensus:: package has so much to offer (and I still have plenty to learn!). The tidycensus::load_variables() function provides a simple way to query the available data within each survey. Combining this with stringr::str_detect() is a nice way to search through the tens of thousands of data series that are available through the U.S. Census API.\n\nload_variables(2022, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE) %&gt;% \n6  filter(str_detect(label, \"Under 5 years\"))\n\n\n6\n\nThis searches all variable labels for “Under 5 years” to help identify data of interest.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 240 × 4\n   name        label                                    concept        geography\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                                    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 B01001A_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years   Sex by Age (W… tract    \n 2 B01001A_018 Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years Sex by Age (W… tract    \n 3 B01001B_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years   Sex by Age (B… tract    \n 4 B01001B_018 Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years Sex by Age (B… tract    \n 5 B01001C_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years   Sex by Age (A… tract    \n 6 B01001C_018 Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years Sex by Age (A… tract    \n 7 B01001D_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years   Sex by Age (A… tract    \n 8 B01001D_018 Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years Sex by Age (A… tract    \n 9 B01001E_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years   Sex by Age (N… tract    \n10 B01001E_018 Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years Sex by Age (N… tract    \n# ℹ 230 more rows\n\n\nFor this demo, I’ll use the following series:\n\nB01001_003: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial groups)\nB01001_027: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial groups)\nB17001_004: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years\nB17001_018: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years\n\nThere are a bunch of useful helper functions/arguments to assist in fetching data from the Census API. Some noteworthy ones include:\n\nEach variable returns the geography, an estimate, and the margin of error (“moe”). Geographies can span from states, regions and the country as a whole, down to areas like school districts, voting districts, census block groups, and many others.\nsurvey=: this defines the produce that you’re using of the American Community Survey. Responses can include “acs1”, “acs3”, or (the default) “acs5”.\nsummary_var=: often the variable that you want would be made more meaningful as a ratio or with a demonminator. For example, the number of children in poverty could be useful on its own, but you’re likely to want to see that series as a percent of the total children. With the summary_var argument, you can tell the function which secondary variable you want to grab in the same API call.\nouput=wide: related to the above, I wanted to look at child poverty in a way that would require multiple summary variables (e.g. the percent of girls and boys in poverty). Since you can only have one summary variable, output='wide' allows you to grab all of the series that you may need in the same call.\ngeometry=TRUE: this argument returns the geospatial data in tidy format to create quick ggplot-based maps using geom_sf().\n\n\ndf &lt;- get_acs(geography = 'state',\n        variables = c(male_u5_pop = 'B01001_003', \n                      female_u5_pop = 'B01001_027', \n                      male_u5_poverty = 'B17001_004', \n                      female_u5_poverty = 'B17001_018'),\n        survey = 'acs5',\n        year = 2022,\n        output = 'wide')\n\nGetting data from the 2018-2022 5-year ACS\n\n\nNext, I’ll create some fields to combine gender-based poverty estimates and calculate a percent of the child population measure.\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  rename(state = NAME) %&gt;% \n  mutate(total_u5_popE = male_u5_popE + female_u5_popE,\n         total_u5_povertyE = male_u5_povertyE + male_u5_povertyE,\n         perc_u5_in_poverty = total_u5_povertyE / total_u5_popE)\n\nYou can combine point estimates for gender-based poverty by simply adding them, but you can’t do the same for margins of error. The estimated margins of error for each estimate are based on their respective samples and the uncertainty in them. To re-weight the margins of error, you take the square root of the sum of squared margins of error:\n\nnew_MOE_calc = sqrt(male_u5_povertyM^2 + female_u5_povertyM^2)\n\nThe tidycensus::moe_sum() function will calculate the new margin of error for you!\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  group_by(state) %&gt;% \n  mutate(total_u5_poverty_MOEcalc = moe_sum(male_u5_povertyM, female_u5_povertyM),\n         perc_u5_in_poverty_MOEcalc = total_u5_poverty_MOEcalc / total_u5_popE)\n\nNow, I can visualize the new point estimates and margins of error for child poverty (not specific to gender).\n\ndf %&gt;% \n7  filter(state != 'Puerto Rico') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x=perc_u5_in_poverty, \n        y=reorder(state, perc_u5_in_poverty))) + \n  geom_point(size=3) +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=perc_u5_in_poverty - perc_u5_in_poverty_MOEcalc, \n                     xmax=perc_u5_in_poverty + perc_u5_in_poverty_MOEcalc),\n                 height = 0.4) + \n  labs(y='',\n       x='',\n       caption=caption_text) + \n  ggtitle(title_text,\n          subtitle=subtitle_text) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent,\n                     position = 'top') + \n  my.theme\n\n\n7\n\nRemoving Puerto Rico because it’s not within a U.S. Census region."
