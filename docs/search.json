    "title": "Part One: Exploring child poverty data with the tidycensus R package",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve used data from the U.S. Census Bureau several times, and for this project, I wanted to reacquaint myself with the tidycensus:: package to gather and wrangle data. I also wanted to use the usmap:: package to generate a simple U.S. map, and the gt:: package to display the data in a nice table format.\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(usmap)\n\n# census_api_key('INSERT KEY HERE')\n\n\n\n\nFor this analysis, I’m interested in looking at the most recent state-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau. The tidycensus:: package allows API access to the decennial Census, as well as the more frequent American Community Survey (ACS), which I’ll use in this project.\nIf you’ve worked with ACS data before, you may know that there are a few survey products offered in the ACS suite. Most commonly, the choice of data is between the 1-year estimates and the 5-year estimates.\nWhat’s the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nACS 1-Year Estimates\nACS 5-Year Estimates\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Period\n12 months\n60 months\n\n\nPopulation Coverage\nAreas with 65,000 or more people\nAll geographic areas, including those with fewer than 65,000 people\n\n\nSample Size\nSmallest\nLargest\n\n\nReliability\nLess reliable due to smaller sample size\nMore reliable due to larger sample size\n\n\nCurrency\nMost current data\nLess current, includes older data\n\n\nRelease Frequency\nAnnually\nAnnually\n\n\nBest Used For\nAnalyzing large populations, when currency is more important than precision\nAnalyzing small populations, where precision is more important than currency\n\n\nExample Usage\nExamining recent economic changes\nExamining trends in small geographic areas or small population subgroups\n\n\n\n\nTo start, I am interested in reviewing the most stable, geographically-available data on child poverty. Given that I’m less concerned with recency and more interested in broad availability, the ACS 5-year estimates are what I’ll use here.\n\n\n\nThe tidycensus:: package has so much to offer (and I still have plenty to learn!). The tidycensus::load_variables() function provides a simple way to query the available data within each survey.
