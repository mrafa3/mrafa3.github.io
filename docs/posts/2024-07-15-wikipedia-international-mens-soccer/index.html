<p>This project has three purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To show how to run R, SQL, and Python all interchangeably in a Quarto document</li>
<li>To compare the ease of writing code using dplyr (R), SQL, and pandas (Python)</li>
<li>To include some demonstration of SQL in my portfolio (which is often not included but remains a critical skill)</li>

<p>The <code>DBI::</code> package allows you to create an in-memory database to query against. The <a href="https://r-dbi.org/">DBI project site</a> is a great place to learn more about it. I’ll start by doing some initial setup and establishing the connection between the R dataframe and the SQL table name that I’ll query.</p>

<p>The <code>reticulate::</code> package allows for executing Python code in an R environment. The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate project site</a> includes useful examples for getting up and running with Python in R. This package includes an <code>r_to_py()</code> function that is needed to convert an R dataframe into a pandas dataframe.</p>

<p>When inserting a code chunk to your Markdown file, it originally defaults to ‘{r}’. You can simply change this to ‘python’ or ‘sql’ and, with the above set up, the code works beautifully in a Quarto document!</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, I used ChatGPT to generate prompts as querying exercises.</p>
