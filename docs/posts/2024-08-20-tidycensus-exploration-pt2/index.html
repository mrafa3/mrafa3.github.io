<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In <a href="https://mrafa3.github.io/posts/2024-08-13-tidycensus-exploration/">Part One</a>, I demonstrated how to fetch data and do some basic analysis of U.S. Census data. Each API call with the <code>tidycensus::</code> package can only be for one year of data, so to do longitudinal analysis requires some additional wrangling. In this post, I’ll build a script that iterates through the available years, fetches the data, then combines the data into a single dataframe. Then, I’ll unpack some of the trends seen in child poverty in Colorado.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>For this analysis, I’m interested in looking at the most recent state-level child poverty data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, and I want to construct a longitudinal sense of the change in child poverty.</p>
<p>First, let’s revisit the different American Community Survey products – <strong>ACS-1</strong> and <strong>ACS-5</strong>.</p>
<p><em>What’s the difference between these, and how do you choose which survey product to use for your purposes?</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In Part One, I wanted to fetch the most recent, reliable estimates for state-level and county-level poverty data, which led me to use the 5-year estimates. For this post, I am interested in constructing a longitudinal dataset of the most recent year-on-year estimates. If I again used the 5-year estimates, I would be comparing results across years that include much of the same sampling period (as shown in the graphic below).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="acs_sample_explained.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>The ACS-5 product has a 60-month sampling period for each annual release, meaning that 48 months of sampling overlap with each annual ACS-5 release<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For this analysis, I’ll use the 1-year estimates from the American Community Survey, which will limit my ability to analyze changes in geographic units with populations greater than 65,000.</p>
<p>As I did in Part One, I’ll use the following series from the American Community Survey:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>B01001_003</em>: Estimate!!Total:!!Male:!!Under 5 years (all racial groups)</li>
<li><em>B01001_027</em>: Estimate!!Total:!!Female:!!Under 5 years (all racial groups)</li>
<li><em>B17001_004</em>: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below poverty level:!!Male:!!Under 5 years</li>
<li><em>B17001_018</em>: Estimate!!Total:!!Income in the past 12 months below poverty level:!!Female:!!Under 5 years</li>
</ul>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>For the graphics, I’ll use Observable Plot to build some interactive graphics (this can be done with R, but I want to experiment more with what Javascript can do).</p>
<p>To use Observable Plot in Quarto, you need to first have your data object defined in an Observable JS object, which can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading in the object directly as an Observable JS object (such as with the <code>FileAttachment()</code> function), or</li>
<li>Converting your R or Python object using the <code>ojs_define()</code> function in an R or Python code chunk</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, if you choose the latter (which I’ll do here), this object only operates when your site or knitr document is rendered (meaning, it won’t execute as a code chunk like you can with R, Python, or SQL in Quarto).</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Then, I’ll create a line plot of child poverty by county over time, faceting by region.</p>

<p>Some comments on the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are discussions online that indicate that not all Javascript styling works in Quarto, and this supports that (some font size elements don’t seem to work, faceting options, etc.). I’d like to test that in Observable directly, but for now, I’ll just note that this is not my <em>favorite</em> styling.</li>
<li>Aside from the Front Range, which is showing some smooth patterns, there’s pretty significant volatility in these child poverty estimates. I’ll rebuild this chart, using a 3-year moving average with the <code>zoo::rollmean()</code> function.</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this <code>tidycensus::</code> post, I demonstrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to fetch data across multiple years from the U.S. Census Bureau and wrangle the data for longitudinal analysis</li>
<li>How to move between R or Python objects and Observable JS objects in Quarto</li>
<li>How to make some simple interactive graphics with Observable Plot</li>
</ul>
<p>More to come on poverty analysis in future posts!</p>
